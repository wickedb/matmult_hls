# Matrix mutliplication using HLS on Xilinx Vitis 

## HLS

High-level synthesis, sometimes referred to as C synthesis, electronic system-level synthesis, algorithmic synthesis, or behavioral synthesis, is an automated design process that takes an abstract behavioral specification of a digital system and find a register-transfer level structure that realizes the given behavior.

## Specifications

The matrices are 100x100, generated and filled with random numbers in the testbench. 

## Usage

- Create a vitis project. 
- The opt_tb.c is equivalent of a "testbench" and should be added as a simulation source. 
- The other two files are sources. Add one of them as a source and run simulation and synthesis. Repeat with the other source file. 

## Report 

### Cycle count reduction and area blow up
